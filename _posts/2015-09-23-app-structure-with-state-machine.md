title: Structure your app with a State Machine
---

**Problem:** to keep your app's structure manageable and efficient.

**Baseline:** for some cases, a [StackView](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls-stackview.html#using-stackview-in-an-application) works well.

**Improvement:** for more complex cases, a [Declarative State Machine](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlstatemachine.html) helps keeping it manageable.

```QML
import QtQuick.Window 1.2

Window {

}
```
